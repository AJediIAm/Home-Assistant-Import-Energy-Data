For different providers already (python) conversion scripts exist. To make life easier a template python script(```TemplateDataPrepare.py```) has been created. This script can be easily used for energy providers for which there is not yet a script available. The template script can be used by filling in the needed information about the structure of the energy input file.

Please share any (template)script and sample data for any Energy provider which is not yet supported!
