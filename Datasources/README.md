# Datasources

For different providers (python) conversion scripts exist. To make life easier a template python script(```TemplateDataPrepare.py```) has been created. This script can be easily used for energy providers for which there is not yet a script available. The template script can be used by filling in the needed information about the structure of the energy input file.

The following input dataformats are supported:
- CSV
- XLS/XLSX
- JSON

Please share any (template)script and sample data for any energy provider which is not yet supported!
